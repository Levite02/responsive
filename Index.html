      <h2>Code editor</h2>
      <P>The code of almost all programming languages is composed of some form of text. So, to write the code, we need a text editor. But it needs to be an application that writes plain text (it canโ€t be a rich text editor, like MS Word). In other words, just a plain notepad that can write .txt files is enough to write code, although itโ€s much easier if you use a dedicated code editor. The market is full of professional code editors, both free and paid. Some of them are universal, while others are exclusive to specific languages. The main advantage of using a dedicated code editor is syntax</P>
      <p>
        Here are some popular ones:
      </p>
      <!--list--->
      <ul>
        <li>Visual studio code</li>
        <p>
          Powerful code editor free for both personal and commercial use. It has quickly become one of the favorites when it comes to web development. It has built-in features like a JavaScript debugger, and tools to streamline web projects.
        </p>
        <li>Sublime text</li>
        <p>
          Fast and easy-to-use code editor with many advanced features, like multiple-line editing, fast search, and others. A trial version is available, but for long-term usage, a license needs to be purchased for both private and commercial use.
        </p>
        <li>Webstorm</li>
        <p>
          A popular commercial development environment, in which the code editor is just one of the smaller elements in a huge set of tools that improve code development (e.g. supporting testing).
        </p>
        <li>Notepad++</li>
        <p>
          Free and lightweight code and text editor. The program is small and fast, supports dozens of programming languages, and can be extended with plugins. It may be old and ugly, but itโ€s still sharp.
